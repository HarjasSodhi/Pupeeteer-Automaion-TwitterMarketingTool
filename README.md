# Pupeeteer-Automaion-TwitterMarketingTool
An Automation program that helps businessmen and service Providers find potential clients based on their tweet keywords and hashtags.
Hi guys!

I have tried to create a Simple digitalmarketing tool for businessmen and service providers.

All you need to do is Enter your Field of Business (for eg-dancing classes).Then the program goes to a website and scrapes all the related words to the field the user has entered.

After that the program converts the words into a String format that is Understood by the #twitter search mechanism.

User can Also add hashtags for better results(Here I have used "#teachmetodance") and after that the Program automatically sends a custom message to the people who show up in the search .

The number of people to message and the message itself can be decided by the user.

The data of the people messaged is stored in a JSON file too so you can contact them yourself if you wish.

If you run the program again for the same field ,then the program DOES NOT message the people previously messaged.  

For Using the code just add your username,id and password in the variables.and after installing the puppeteer library,the code should work perfectly.
You might have to experiment with the a few Hashtags for getting results
